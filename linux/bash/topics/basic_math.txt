#here to do mathematical expressions "expr" command is used before expression.
example :-
expr 20 + 10
expr 20 - 10
expr 20 / 10
expr 20 \* 10
#but for multiplication escape character(\) is used, because here(20 * 10) is special character and it as some other purpose, "*" represents "everything" and it gives error as "20: command not found"
num1=100
echo "num1 is: $num1" (o/p: num1 is 100)
num2=50
echo "num2 is: $num2" (o/p: num2 is 50)
echo "sum of num1 and num2 is: $(expr $num1 + $num2)" (o/p: sum of num1 and num2 is 150)
