#exit codes are used to find out whether the entered command is executed properly or it raised any error
#after a command is execuited, if it fails it raises the error
#but in linux there is a command to see if the previous command is properly execuited

#the ocmmand is "echo #?"
#the output of echo #? is either "0" or other number
#the 0 as the output means the command is execuited successfully,other than 0 means it raised an error

#to redirect the output of a command to a file use
package=htop //package=notexist (can be used to record error)
sudo apt install $package >> package_install_result.log

#to exit/stop the execution of the script in between and to write a exit code to it use "exit <some_number>"

#age=19
#if [ $age -gt 18 ]
#then
#       echo "major"
#       exit 0
#else
#       echo "minor"
#       exit 0
#fi
#echo "you will not see line"
#echo "also this line"
#echo "it is due to 'exit command'"
